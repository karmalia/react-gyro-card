# GyroCard Component

The GyroCard component provides a React component that allows you to create a 3D perspective effect on its children elements based on mouse movement.

## Installation

To install the library, use the following command:

```bash
npm i react-gyro-card
```

# Usage

Here's how you can use the GyroCard component in your React application:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import GyroCard from "gyrocard";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <GyroCard strength={10} perspective="high" classNames="my-gyro-card">
        <div>Your 3D content here</div>
      </GyroCard>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## EPerspective `advance`

For chaning perspective, if you are not comfortable with this prop, don't change it.

```typescript
export enum EPerspective {
  "high" = 2000,
  "default" = 1000,
  "low" = 500,
  "lowest" = 100,
}
```
